## :soccer: eFootball Points Calculator

A calculator for the eFootball™ game that shows you exactly how many points you need to reach your desired player rating, based on your current game stats- with an incremental calculation algorithm. All a user needs to do is enter the point they're currently at, the point they want to reach, and how many points they can spend on upgrading.

## :pushpin: The Process
It was a typical Sunday morning when my dad started talking about point increases in his favorite game, eFootball. He explained how the points you earn can be spent to upgrade players’ stats—things like passing, defending, and dexterity—but the system isn’t linear. After every four points you invest, the cost of each subsequent upgrade increases by one point, and it keeps rising from there. As soon as he described it, I realized there had to be a formula behind it, and he agreed it could be modeled with some programming. The idea intrigued me, and it seemed like a great workout for my brain, made even more satisfying by the fact that it came from a real-world scenario.

I started working on it with C- with getting user input, validating it, setting up a main() function and most importantly- creating a function for the points calculation. I had the idea of using a for-loop with 4 iterations for the points increment, and maybe even a while-loop somewhere, which turned out to be just what the program needed.

It wasn't a _complete_ walk in the park though, because I simply wasn't getting the numbers right. So, I pulled up OneNote started visualizing the algorithm with a concrete example, and then was successfully able to come up with a working algorithm for it. It finally worked with different inputs, which was satisfying in itself. But this was only a .c file, and making it a web-link for quick access was one of my goals for this exercise. So I wrote the same program with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and whipped up the frontend. It turned out great in my opinion. It was a fun exercise to see something we take for granted (i.e spending points on upgrades) from the real-world and make it into algorithm form.
