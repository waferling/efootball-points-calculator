## :soccer: eFootball Points Calculator

A calculator for the eFootball™ game that shows you exactly how many points you need to reach your desired player rating, based on your current game stats- with an incremental calculation algorithm. All a user needs to do is enter the point they're currently at, the point they want to reach, and how many points they can spend on upgrading.

## :pushpin: The Process
It was a regular Sunday morning. My dad then came up to me and started talking about point increases in his favorite game: eFootball. He told me how earned points could be spent on football players to upgrade their stats like passing, defending, dexterity, but it _wasn’t_ a linear system. After every 4 points that were spent, you'd have to spend 1 extra point from then on, and it would keep going up. I knew that there could be a formula then, and he agreed that this could be done with some programming. It sounded interesting and I knew it would be a nice exercise for my brain. Plus, the fact that this was a real-world scenario made it all the more gratifying.

I started working on it with C- with getting user input, validating it, setting up a main() function and most importantly- creating a function for the points calculation. I had the idea of using a for-loop with 4 iterations for the points increment, and maybe even a while-loop somewhere, which turned out to be just what the program needed.

It wasn't a _complete_ walk in the park though, because I simply wasn't getting the numbers right. So, I pulled up OneNote started visualizing the algorithm with a concrete example, and then was successfully able to come up with a working algorithm for it. It finally worked with different inputs, which was satisfying in itself. But this was only a .c file, and making it a web-link for quick access was one of my goals for this exercise. So I wrote the same program with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and whipped up the frontend. It turned out great in my opinion. It was a fun exercise to see something we take for granted (i.e spending points on upgrades) from the real-world and make it into algorithm form.
